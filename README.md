# test

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

FlutterFlow projects are built to run on the Flutter _stable_ release.

Here's a step-by-step guide to clone your FlutterFlow app from GitHub to your local environment and run it in Visual Studio Code:

### Prerequisites
1. **Visual Studio Code**: Ensure you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed.
2. **Flutter SDK**: Install the [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
3. **Git**: Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
1. **Open VS Code**:
   - Launch Visual Studio Code.

2. **Open the Command Palette**:
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac) to open the command palette.
   - Type `Git: Clone` and select it.

3. **Enter the Repository URL**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository and copy the URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repo-name.git`).
   - Paste the URL into the prompt in VS Code and press `Enter`.

4. **Select a Local Folder**:
   - Choose a location on your computer where you want to save the cloned project, then click "Select Repository Location."
   - After cloning, VS Code might prompt you to open the project in the current window; select `Open`.

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies
1. **Open a New Terminal**:
   - In VS Code, go to `Terminal` > `New Terminal`.

2. **Run Flutter Command**:
   - In the terminal, navigate to the project folder if not already there.
   - Run the following command to fetch all dependencies:
     ```bash
     flutter pub get
     ```

#### Step 3: Configure Your Device or Emulator
1. **Connect a Device or Open an Emulator**:
   - Connect your Android/iOS device via USB (ensure Developer Mode is enabled).
   - Or, open an emulator (Android Studio offers one if installed).

2. **Select Your Device in VS Code**:
   - In the bottom right of VS Code, click on `No Device` (if applicable) and choose your device/emulator from the list.

#### Step 4: Run the Flutter Project
1. **Run the App**:
   - In the terminal, run:
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```
   - Alternatively, press `F5` to start debugging and running the app directly in VS Code.

#### Step 5: Troubleshoot (if needed)
- If you encounter any issues, ensure that your Flutter SDK is set up correctly by running:
  ```bash
  flutter doctor
  ```
- This command will show any missing dependencies or configurations you need to address.

After following these steps, your app should compile and run in your emulator or connected device. Let me know if any specific issues come up!
